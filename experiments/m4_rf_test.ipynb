    "# Random Forest Forecast (M4 Data)\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook evaluates a **Random Forest** model on a subset of the M4 Financial dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Methodology\n",
    "- **Local Training**: A separate RF model is trained for each time series (matching the NN-kNN and ARIMA baselines).\n",
    "- **Feature Engineering**: Unlike the raw-window approach of NN-kNN, we use technical indicators (RSI, MA, MACD, Volatility) generated by the `FeatureBuilder`.\n",
    "- **Multi-Output Forecasting**: The model is trained to predict the next $H$ steps simultaneously (Direct/Multi-output strategy).\n",
    "- **Interpretability**: We extract explicit decision rules and feature importance to demonstrate the \"white-box\" nature of the tree model."
